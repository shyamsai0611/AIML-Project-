Group 2 Week 2 Approach/Algorithm :
Step 1: Create a BST. Take input of all the node values and push
	all the elements into a BST
Step 2: Perform Inorder Traversal. Inorder traversal of BST will 
	always be in ascending order. So we perform inorder traversal 
	and store all the inorder traversal in a array(vector)
Step 3: Now the resultant array of after the inorder order travesal is
	min heap in array representation. 
Step 4: Now we will build an Heap tree using the heap array 
		1st child - 2i
		2nd child - 2i + 1
	In this way we access the children elements and make heap 
Step 5: Perform Level Order Traversal

Time Complexity:
	Let 'n' be number of nodes then
	O(n log(n) + 3n) ~ O(n log(n))
		n log n - to create BST
		2n - O(n) for inorder traveral and O(2n) for Level order traveral
Space Complexity: O(3n) 
		- to create heap and BST and queue
